Create a form with an input field where one can enter the url to an atom feed.
Fetch the feed and render the list of articles in a list with React. Use redux and don't be afraid of ES6. There's no need for any backend code unless it's absolutely required.
Put the project online somewhere we can play with it and send us the link to the github code.
We're assessing the js/react skills, css/html knowledge, cleanliness of the code, attention to details. Bonus points for using css-modules.
The project can be done in a few hours, we don't want to take too much of your time.
Example feed you can play with: your github activity feed. https://github.com/<username>.atom
